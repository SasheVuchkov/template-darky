### Almost “Production-Ready” Next.Js Portfolio Template

The template is somewhat “production-ready,” meaning that it comes with all the libraries you need to deploy it as a static website on CloudFlare, Vercel, or another cloud vendor.

You just need to create a few blog posts, add some past projects, and change the copy on the rest of the pages.

Then it’s a piece of cake to deploy it…

Moreover, I planned this template as a “marketing machine.” That means it has all the basic “marketing stuff” that you need if you want to create a great first impression. It will help you get the best job offerings on the market or win the best freelance projects.

And the best news?

It’s free. You just need to sign up for a free membership, and you will get immediate access once you confirm your email address.
